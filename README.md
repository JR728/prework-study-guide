## Description
The motivation behind this project was to learn how to build a basic website with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I built this project so I can have notes of the basic launguges of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in a more digestable way.
I can refer to this webpage when i forget what a certian part of code is supposed to do. It gives me a basic template of a website. 
I learned about the structure of HTML,CSS, and JavaScrript as well how to navigate Git. Learned the importance of meta data, head, headers, lists and how to divide in sections. I learned how to link CSS and JavaScript to HTML file. In CSS I learned how to use paddings and margins and how to give all elements the stlye properties. Learned how to edit specific parts of margins and paddings. In Git learned commands on how to make branches, commit to branches, pull main branch, and merging the created branch to the main one. In JavaScript i learned how to make varibles and connect them to arrays. I made fuctions with for loops and if else staments and was able to view them in the console.
