        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>StringThis is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number dont have quotes.</li>
          <h3>Variable</h3>
          <li>Boolean is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. Can have string number and boolean.</li>
          <li>Object can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <h3>Operator</h3>
          <li>Addition Add two numbers together or combine two strings. +</li>
          <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division these do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.-,*,/ </li>
          <li>Assignment As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable. =</li>
          <li>Strict equality performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
          <li>Not, Does-not-equal returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.!, !==</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. variable name() is function</li>
          <h3>Types</h3>
          <li>Null return value object</li>
          <li>undefined return value undefined</li>
          <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
          <h3>Data properties</h3>
          <li>Data properties associate a key with a value. It can be described by the following attributes.</li>
          <li>The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value.</li>
          <li>The writable A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment.</li>
          <li>The enumerable A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop.</li>
          <li>The configurable A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to an accessor property, and can have its attributes changed.</li>
          <h3>Accessor properties</h3>
          <li>Accessor property associates a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
          <li>The get A function called with an empty argument list to retrieve the property value whenever a get access to the value is performed. See also getters. May be undefined.</li>
          <li>The set A function called with an argument that contains the assigned value. Executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed. See also setters. May be undefined.</li>
          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
          <h3>Coercion</h3>
          <li>The primitive coercion process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be.</li>
          <li>The numeric coercion is nearly the same as number coercion, except that BigInts are returned as-is instead of causing a TypeError.</li>
